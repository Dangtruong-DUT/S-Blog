# 📘 S-Blog

**S-Blog** is a personal blogging platform built entirely with **React**. Each user becomes their own **blogger** within the site — they can create, edit, delete posts, explore content from others, follow users, and share blog posts to social media.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This repository only contains the **frontend** of the project. It communicates with a pre-existing **REST API** (not included in this repo).
